# Problem

Suppose we have a class:

```cpp
public class Foo {
  public void first() { print("first"); }
  public void second() { print("second"); }
  public void third() { print("third"); }
}
```

The same instance of `Foo` will be passed to 3 different threads.

- Thread A will call `first()`
- Thread B will call `second()`
- Thread C will call `third()`

Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that `second()` is executed after `first()`, and `third()` is executed after `second()`.

# Example

- Input: `[1,3,2]`
- Output: `firstsecondthird`

**Note**: We do not know how the threads will be scheduled in the operating system, even though the numbers in the input seems to imply the ordering. The input format you see is mainly to ensure our tests' comprehensiveness.

# Solution

Threads share memory data, so we can maintain a flag on the object, and each thread will:

1. Check if the current flag to know if it's ready to execute.
2. Execute the function call.
3. Update the flag value to mark the function call as executed.
